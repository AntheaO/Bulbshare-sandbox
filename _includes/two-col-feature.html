          <h2>Strategy</h2>
            <p>NYX Professional Makeup UK want to leverage the consumer love that already exists for their Can't Stop Won't Stop foundation to assert trust amongst consumers and win new customers over to their hero foundation range.</p>          
            <p>To tackle this challenge, NYX Professional Makeup UK uses Makeup Addyx - their fully branded Bulbshare app with 5,000+ makeup artists, consumers and micro influencers - to drive authentic UGC demonstrating the product's benefits and validating their key claims.</p>           
            <p>We have provided NYX Professional Makeup UK with over 400 product reviews, more than 300 pieces of UGC ‘before and after’ videos, and a potential reach of millions via Bulbshare’s unique Social Sharing functionality and Bazaarvoice integration, to create authentic hype and buzz around the foundation. These insights shape the campaign idea, messaging, and look and feel.</p>
